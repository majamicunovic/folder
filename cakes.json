Be careful, because the yolk can fall into the bowl with the egg whites, and if we don't take it out completely, we won't be able to whip the sham. Let the bride and groom separate the egg whites above the other bowl, and from there let them transfer to a whisk. Whisk the egg whites with a mixer, and when the sham is white, add one tablespoon of sugar at a time. When the sham is firmly beaten, add the egg yolks one by one, and set the mixer to the lowest speed. Add one tablespoon of oil at a time. Stir for a short time, then add a teaspoon of baking powder and one by one spoon of sifted flour, then lightly with a mixer, or blender,",
